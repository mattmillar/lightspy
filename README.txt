``LightDump’’, ``LightSensorTest’’, and ``capture-wifi’’ are the most
current projects here (as of 1 Aug 2014).  The first two are Android
Eclipse projects.

	* ``LightDump’’ provides a way to record light sensor data from
	  a device and transmit it to one of several receptacles.
	* ``LightSensorTest’’ is a simple tool to quickly gauge the
	  sampling refresh rate of a device’s light sensor.
	* ``capture-wifi’’ provides a quick and dirty script to capture movie
	  light data in batch, e.g. in conjunction with e.g. LightDump.
	  If you want to copy this script somewhere, copy the entire
	  directory as a unit, otherwise it won’t work.

Also:
	* ``SensorDump’’ is an Android Eclipse project which can be used to
	  read live data from every sensor on a device.
	* ``CameraLightDump’’ and ``DetectMovieApp’’ are older project files
	  from when we were using camera data in lieu of actual light sensor
	  readings.  The above projects use the actual light sensor.



Thank you!
